## ‚è∏Ô∏è Current Blocker: Need User Input for Phase 4D

**Cannot proceed with Phase 4D Planning/Build without the following information:**

### Critical Questions

#### 1. GoHighLevel Account Access
- [ ] Do you have a GoHighLevel agency/location account?
- [ ] Do you have API credentials (OAuth access token)?
- [ ] What is your GHL location ID?
- [ ] Do you have a sandbox/test environment?

#### 2. Pipeline Configuration
- [ ] Do you have a restoration services pipeline created in GHL?
- [ ] What are your pipeline stage IDs?
- [ ] What are the stage names? (e.g., New Lead ‚Üí Quote Sent ‚Üí Won)
- [ ] How should opportunities be assigned in GHL?

#### 3. Provider Network
- [ ] How many restoration contractors are in your network?
- [ ] Do you have their service areas documented?
- [ ] Do you have their specialties documented?
- [ ] Are they set up as users in your GHL account?
- [ ] Do you have their GHL user IDs?

#### 4. Business Rules
- [ ] Should platinum leads always route to premium providers?
- [ ] What is the target assignment time for emergency leads?
- [ ] What happens if no provider matches? (Manual assignment? Hold queue?)
- [ ] Should customers receive automated notifications when assigned?
- [ ] Do providers accept all lead tiers, or do they have preferences?

#### 5. Integration Preferences
- [ ] Should the integration be automatic on lead submission?
- [ ] Do you want a manual approval step for high-value leads?
- [ ] Should there be an admin dashboard to manage assignments?
- [ ] Do you want real-time notifications to providers?

## üéì Technical Learnings from This Session

1. **CopilotKit Integration Pattern**
   - Use `copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint()` helper, not manual `runtime.response()`
   - Let CopilotKit manage Anthropic SDK versions internally
   - Node.js runtime required (not Edge) for Anthropic SDK dependencies

2. **Cost Estimation Best Practices**
   - Use base rates per square foot
   - Apply severity multipliers
   - Add urgency factors
   - Include property type modifiers
   - Always show ranges (¬±20%) to set expectations

3. **Lead Scoring Strategy**
   - Weight by urgency (30%), size (20%), severity (15%)
   - Multi-tier classification helps prioritization
   - Platinum/Gold leads should route to CRM immediately

4. **GHL API V2 Insights**
   - V1 APIs deprecated, use V2 only
   - Rate limits are generous but require queue management
   - Custom fields support allows rich lead data
   - Opportunities must link to existing contacts

## üé¨ Conclusion

**Session Summary**: Successfully completed Phase 4C (AI chat integration) and Phase 4D Scout (GHL research). Build is production-ready for the AI assessment feature. Now blocked waiting for GHL account details to proceed with CRM integration.

**What's Working**:
- ‚úÖ AI chat builds and runs without errors
- ‚úÖ Cost estimation algorithms implemented
- ‚úÖ Lead scoring system operational
- ‚úÖ Supabase integration functional
- ‚úÖ GHL integration architecture designed

**What's Needed**:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è GHL API credentials
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Pipeline configuration details
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Provider network information
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Business rule decisions

**Recommendation**: Before I continue with Phase 4D Build, please:
1. Test the AI chat at http://localhost:3001 to ensure it works as expected
2. Gather GHL account information
3. Answer the 5 critical question sections
4. Provide any feedback on the cost estimation logic or AI conversation flow

Once you provide this information, I can complete the full GHL integration in approximately 14-21 hours of development time.
