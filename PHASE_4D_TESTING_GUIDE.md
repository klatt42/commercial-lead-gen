# Phase 4D Testing Guide
## GoHighLevel Integration - Testing & Validation

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **BUILD COMPLETE** - Ready for Testing
**Integration Type**: Option A - Basic GHL Sync (Contact + Opportunity Creation)

---

## üéØ What Was Built

Successfully implemented automatic GoHighLevel synchronization that:
- ‚úÖ Creates contacts in GHL when leads are submitted
- ‚úÖ Creates opportunities in your "Demo Pipeline"
- ‚úÖ Sets stage to "New Client" automatically
- ‚úÖ Includes all lead data as tags and custom fields
- ‚úÖ Runs in background (non-blocking)
- ‚úÖ Updates Supabase with GHL IDs for tracking
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully with retry logic

---

## üìã Pre-Testing Checklist

### 1. Database Migration Required ‚ö†Ô∏è

**You must run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor BEFORE testing:**

```sql
-- Add GoHighLevel tracking columns to leads table
ALTER TABLE leads
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lead_tier VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lead_score INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS estimated_cost_low INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS estimated_cost_high INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ghl_contact_id VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ghl_opportunity_id VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ghl_sync_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ghl_sync_error TEXT;

-- Add indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_ghl_contact_id ON leads(ghl_contact_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_ghl_opportunity_id ON leads(ghl_opportunity_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_ghl_sync_status ON leads(ghl_sync_status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_lead_tier ON leads(lead_tier);
```

**How to run**:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tyjbkwwntmhxfvwsuvgz
2. Click "SQL Editor" in left menu
3. Create "New Query"
4. Paste the SQL above
5. Click "Run" button

### 2. Verify Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` should have these (already configured):

```bash
# GoHighLevel Configuration
GHL_API_KEY=pit-8810b278-6c24-411b-b681-97dfa282970e
GHL_LOCATION_ID=3MISHSClQuRMqsV7GeCX
GHL_PIPELINE_ID=Y9EBfkzfs15AzXCrwMEM
GHL_STAGE_NEW_CLIENT=8d6c1d41-7c37-4f58-bcc1-e104746d4c84
```

### 3. Restart Development Server

**Important**: You must restart the dev server to load new environment variables.

```bash
# In terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop current server, then:
npm run dev
```

---

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Test 1: Verify GHL Connection

Run the connection test script:

```bash
node scripts/test-ghl-connection.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully connected to GHL!
Found 1 pipeline(s):
Pipeline 1: Demo Pipeline
  ID: Y9EBfkzfs15AzXCrwMEM
  Stages:
    1. New Client
    2. Appt booked
    3. Service Completed
```

If you see errors, check your GHL API key.

### Test 2: Submit a Test Lead via Form

1. **Open** http://localhost:3001
2. **Fill out the contact form** at the bottom of the page:
   - Business Name: "Test Company ABC"
   - Your Name: "John Doe"
   - Phone: "555-123-4567"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Service Area: Maryland
   - Property Address: "123 Main St, Baltimore, MD 21201"
   - Property Type: Office Building
   - Property Size: 5000
   - Damage Type: Select "Water"
   - Urgency: Emergency
   - Description: "Testing GHL integration"

3. **Click Submit**
4. **Look for green success message**

### Test 3: Verify in GoHighLevel

1. **Log into GoHighLevel**: https://app.gohighlevel.com/
2. **Go to Contacts** (left menu)
3. **Look for "John Doe"** or "Test Company ABC"
4. **Verify**:
   - Contact exists
   - Phone number matches
   - Email matches
   - Tags include: "emergency", "water", "MD"
   - Custom fields populated

5. **Go to Opportunities** (left menu ‚Üí Opportunities)
6. **Look for opportunity**: "Water Restoration - Test Company ABC"
7. **Verify**:
   - Opportunity exists
   - Status is "Open"
   - Stage is "New Client"
   - Contact is linked
   - Value is populated (if estimate was provided)

### Test 4: Verify in Supabase

1. **Go to Supabase Table Editor**
2. **Open `leads` table**
3. **Find your test lead**
4. **Verify columns populated**:
   - `ghl_contact_id`: Should have a value (looks like: `contact_xxx`)
   - `ghl_opportunity_id`: Should have a value (looks like: `opp_xxx`)
   - `ghl_sync_status`: Should be "synced"
   - `ghl_sync_error`: Should be NULL

### Test 5: Check Server Logs

In your terminal running `npm run dev`, look for:

```
[GHL Integration] createContact:start
[GHL Integration] createContact:success
[GHL Integration] createOpportunity:start
[GHL Integration] createOpportunity:success
[GHL Integration] syncLead:complete
‚úÖ Lead {id} synced to GHL successfully
```

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem: "GHL API Error: 401 Unauthorized"

**Cause**: Invalid or expired API key

**Fix**:
1. Log into GoHighLevel
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí API Keys
3. Generate new API key if expired
4. Update `.env.local` with new key
5. Restart dev server

### Problem: Contact created but no opportunity

**Cause**: Pipeline ID or Stage ID incorrect

**Fix**:
1. Run `node scripts/test-ghl-connection.js` to verify IDs
2. Check `.env.local` has correct `GHL_PIPELINE_ID` and `GHL_STAGE_NEW_CLIENT`
3. Restart dev server

### Problem: "ghl_sync_status" is "failed"

**Cause**: API call failed after retries

**Fix**:
1. Check `ghl_sync_error` column in Supabase for error message
2. Check GHL rate limits (100 req/10sec, 200k/day)
3. Verify GHL account is active

### Problem: Lead saved but `ghl_contact_id` is NULL

**Cause**: GHL sync running in background, may take 1-2 seconds

**Fix**:
1. Wait 5 seconds and refresh Supabase table
2. If still NULL, check server logs for errors
3. Check `ghl_sync_status` column for "failed" status
