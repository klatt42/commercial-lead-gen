    problemTitle: 'The True Cost of Commercial Water Damage',
    problemDescription: 'Water damage in commercial properties goes far beyond wet floors and ceilings. Burst pipes, roof leaks, HVAC failures, and flooding can shut down operations for days or weeks, resulting in lost revenue, damaged inventory, and potential safety hazards for employees and customers. Without immediate professional intervention, water seeps into walls, floors, and building systems, causing exponential damage that compounds hourly. Mold begins growing within 24-48 hours, creating health hazards and requiring costly remediation. Electrical systems become safety risks. Structural integrity deteriorates. What starts as a manageable emergency quickly escalates into a six-figure disaster.',

    problemTitle: 'The Hidden Dangers of Fire & Smoke Damage',
    problemDescription: 'After the fire department leaves, a new threat begins: invisible smoke damage and chemical residues that continue destroying your commercial property. Smoke penetrates HVAC systems, spreading soot and odor throughout unaffected areas. Acidic soot residues corrode metals, permanently etch glass, and discolor walls within 48-72 hours. Porous materials absorb smoke odors that intensify over time. Water damage from firefighting efforts compounds the problem, creating mold risks. Electrical systems may be compromised, creating fire hazards. Without immediate professional intervention, salvageable property becomes total loss. The longer smoke and soot remain, the more extensive and expensive the damage becomes. Many business owners underestimate post-fire damage, discovering weeks later that "cleaned" areas still reek of smoke or that structural damage went undetected.',

    solutionTitle: 'Complete Fire Damage Restoration & Recovery',
    solutionDescription: 'Our commercial fire damage restoration begins with emergency board-up and security services to protect your property. We conduct comprehensive structural assessments to identify hidden fire, smoke, and water damage.

    problemTitle: 'The Business Impact of Commercial Mold Contamination',
    problemDescription: "Mold is more than an unsightly nuisance--it's a serious business threat. Mold spores cause respiratory issues, allergic reactions, and aggravate asthma, creating potential liability for employee health problems and OSHA violations. Visible mold damages your business reputation, driving away customers and clients who question your facility's cleanliness and safety. Hidden mold growing in HVAC systems, wall cavities, or ceiling tiles continuously contaminates indoor air, affecting everyone in the building. Property values decline as mold issues surface during inspections or sales. Insurance claims become complicated when mold damage is discovered. Most concerning: DIY mold cleanup often makes the problem worse by spreading spores throughout the building without addressing the underlying moisture problem. Without professional remediation, mold colonies return repeatedly, creating a cycle of health complaints, expensive treatments, and business disruptions.",

    solutionTitle: 'EPA-Certified Professional Mold Remediation',
    solutionDescription: "Our commercial mold remediation follows strict EPA and IICRC protocols to safely remove mold and prevent recurrence. We begin with comprehensive mold inspection and air quality testing to identify all contaminated areas and measure spore levels. During remediation, we establish negative air pressure containment to prevent spore spread, safely remove all mold-contaminated materials, clean and treat affected surfaces with antimicrobial solutions, and use HEPA filtration to capture airborne spores. Critically, we identify and eliminate the moisture source causing mold growth--whether it's plumbing leaks, HVAC condensation, roof leaks, or high humidity. Post-remediation air quality testing confirms successful mold removal. We document everything for your records, insurance claims, and potential regulatory requirements. Our goal: restore a healthy indoor environment and prevent future mold issues.",

        question: 'Is mold dangerous? Should we evacuate the building?',
        answer: 'Mold produces spores and mycotoxins that can cause health effects ranging from allergic reactions and respiratory issues to more serious problems for immunocompromised individuals. Evacuation depends on contamination extent and affected population. Small contained areas rarely require evacuation. Extensive contamination or sensitive populations (healthcare facilities, schools) may warrant temporary relocation of affected areas.
